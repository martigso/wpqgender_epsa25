::: {.column}


[[Hypothesis 1:]{.midgreen} _WPQ language is more likely to be similar to questions by other MPs of the same gender_]{.fragment}


[[Hypothesis 2:]{.orange} _Language is even more aligned with one’s own gender if the receiving minister is also of the same gender_]{.fragment}

# Methods {.smaller}

:::: {.columns}

- [Data]{.darkred}
    - All WPQs from 1998-2021
        - (We will expand to 2025 after the election)
    - N = $29,701$
- [Measurement]{.blue}
    - XGboost classification of gender $[0,1]$ [@wackerle2023distinctive]

::: {.column .fragment .nonincremental}

- [Estimation]{.midgreen}
    - Overall trends: Fractional logit with gender measure as DV
    - Immediate effect: RD on minister post change
        - Woman &rarr; Man
        - Man &rarr; Woman

# Summary { .smaller }

::: {.nonincremental}

1. WPQs are (also) gendered by sender
    - Women use more similar language to other women
    - Vice versa for men
2. WPQs are gendered by receiver
    - [Overall:]{.darkcyan} 
        - Women MPs use more feminine language when receiving minister is a woman
        - No effect for men
    - [Immediate:]{.orange}
        - Minister man &rarr; woman: Women/men MPs more masculine language
        - Minister woman &rarr; man: Men MPs more feminine language
